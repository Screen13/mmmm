# SpriteSheetPacker
Tool for creating sprite sheets.

With this software you can add all the images in a single file and a configuration file is automatically generated to be read from the MMMM engine.
This program generates a map file not directly supported by MMMM. So it was created the "screen13packer" tool that converts files from SpriteSheetPacker to JSON format compatible with PIXI.js and MMMM.
SpriteSheetPacker is an original work by Nick Gravelyn.
